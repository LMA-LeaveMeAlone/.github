You will notice that the global project contains differents repositories in which there are:

* **server**, which provides a REST API for the mobile application, and MQTT to work with all the IoT you can find in the front of the door. It will also make a relation between them.
* **remote-server**, which provides REST API for records.
* **mobile-app**, which is the mobile application for android. The user will be able to interact with the door.
